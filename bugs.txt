1. Tasks Schema contained both autoValue and defaultValue.
      ----> defaultValue removed
2. Author ID could have been neglected in server-side validation because 'autoform' object in its schema is only used at client
      ----> Moved autoform.autoValue to authorId schema
3. SimpleSchema was not implemented in server as it wasn't imported anywhere in server code
      ----> Imported in /imports/startup/server/index.js
